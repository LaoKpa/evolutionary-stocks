# Evolutionary Algorithms for optimizing stock portfolio

This project aims to deliver an optimal combination of given stocks based on their past values. Several optimization criteria are provided:

* Estimated Return
* Volatality
* Sharpe Ratio

A stock portfolio is represented as a binary tree and evolutionary algorithms are performed on such trees to optimize their contents. See [this paper by Aranha and Hitoshi](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1389095.1389267) for details.

Note: This originated as a school project. Needs a lot of refactoring and extending before it can be of any use.
